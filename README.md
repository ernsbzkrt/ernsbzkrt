👋 Hi, I’m @ernsbzkrt! As a developer who has been working in the field of data science for many years, I now aim to pivot my career towards Quantum Computing. In this repository, I intend to share the knowledge I've acquired in this field and collaborate with others to develop meaningful projects. My goal is to build a community and work together on innovative solutions by bridging the gap between data science and quantum computing, leveraging my expertise in both areas to make valuable contributions.

👀 I’m interested in Quantum Computing and Quantum Physics topics. Although not immediately, I am certain that I will pursue a PhD in this field in the near future.

🌱 I’m currently learning Quantum Computing and Quantum Physics.
